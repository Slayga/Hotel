## Pull Requests

It's free, do it. All we desire from you as a contributor is your pledge to not request addition of code that is sensitive or harmful in any way. 
That may cause issues on later hand

1. When doing a pull request, make sure to review your own changes. Make sure nothing is weird or complicated or a security risk.
2. Comment the necessary, Example: `x = 1` is not necessary to comment, while an advance or complex algorithm can be commented to give oversight to what it does, furthermore comment inside the algorithm.
3. We don't ask for anything in return, and we don't expect too be asked.
